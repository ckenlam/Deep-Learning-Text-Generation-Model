Inspired by Janelle Shane's [Pickup Line Generator](https://aiweirdness.com/post/159302925452/the-neural-network-generated-pickup-lines-that-are), I attempted to train a recurrent neural network that can come up with its own Bro Codes using data from the following sources:
- https://brocode.org/the-code/
- http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/barney-stinson/articles/162623/title/chicks-code

The model managed to come up with some novel ones:
- 'A bro is unacceptable in sandals.'
- 'A bro is honor bound to drink'
- 'A bro always grow a moustache of armpits'
- 'A bro will not sleep in front of bros. no'
- 'A bro never tickles another bro's muscles'
- 'A bro will order any type of alcoholic drink she wants'
- 'A bro is honour bound to accept all style chick'
- 'A bro does not choose his own wrestling challenges when a chick orders'
- 'A bro never gives another bro’s toothbrush they wouldn’t try them self .'
- 'A bro never willingly relinquishes possession of a bachelor party'
- 'A bro never lets another bro drink with any married bros'
- 'A bro will only be supportive of all decisions of his side chicks .'
- 'A bro is honor bound to his wife .'
- 'A bro is always completely respectful to music in a bar'
- 'When a bro is in doubt , he shall consider the actions of chuck norris'

These ones make no sense, but are still grammatically correct (to a certain extent):
- 'If a bro asks out a guitar at a party , he will leave a quarter'
- 'If a bro asks , a chick may not be tolerated in another bro to toss a banana'
- 'When a bro dies while lifting weights  , he is required to sit him twice before she must honor the weird wait three days'
- 'A bro never facetimes , skypes or uses any other guy and chair for cue .'
- 'A bro never borrows or lends clothes of another bro to eating a banana '
